## Notes

- This checklist should be updated as tasks are completed
- Blocked tasks should be documented in `docs/owner_log.md`
- Each major component should be tested independently before integration
- Use `scripts/setup_sim.py` for continuous verification during development
- Reference `config/env/setup_instructions.md` for detailed setup guidance
